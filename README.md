The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations

* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

## Notes

I wasn't careful and I initially was using SwiftUI and nothing was matching my expectations! At first I thought the storyboard was just different, but the swift files were header files somehow!
Tracing back to the beginning and re-doing the app from scratch made me a little sad. I'm not the best designer so I chose to do the other optional features. 
The GIF makers weren't working well for me, so I recorded with QuickTime and then converted it to a GIF. However, the gif is too long so I couldn't display all of them at once, hence I had to break it down into multiple gifs and change some frame rates around.
