Tip Calculator is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Monica Yao 

Time spent: 4.5 hours spent in total 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] A toggle for if the user wants to input a custom tip amount

## Notes

I wasn't careful and I initially was using SwiftUI and nothing was matching my expectations! At first I thought the storyboard was just different, but the swift files were header files somehow!
Tracing back to the beginning and re-doing the app from scratch made me a little sad. I'm not the best designer so I chose to do the other optional features. 
The GIF makers weren't working well for me, so I recorded with QuickTime and then converted it to a GIF. However, the gif is too long so I couldn't display all of them at once, hence I had to break it down into multiple gifs and then upload it onto imgur (sorry for not following directions, I tried to find a way to insert a link but they get erased off of the servers).
